## 1. User Input Failures

Link to commit: https://github.com/JorgeC001/ShapesCalculatorProject/commit/ff917a409cd2ee561dc240f854edbadbf3a61ecc

Code was added to the main file to handle user input, in the first case in main it checks that a user entered a number from 1 to 5 otherwise it will give an error message and terminate the program. Similarly, for the set value functions the user input gets checked by the isdigit() function, if the input is invalid it will give an error message and terminate the program. This will be further improved later so that the program loops until a valid input is recognized.

## 2. Back-Up Policy

A back-up of the files was saved onto a separate hard drive incase the original gets lost or stolen.

## Next Items

* Encryption (Priority: High) (Moderate) - Ensure that the project source code is encrypted and secure.
* Security Testing (Priority: High) (Difficult) - Check the code for vulnerabilities and possible security holes.
* Adequate Commenting (Priority: Mid) (Easy) - Improve the quality of comments so that the code can be better maintained.
* Further Logging (Priority: High) (Difficult) - Improve the accounting of the programming.
